# Why use DSA?
- `DSA => Data + Structure + Algorithm`
- Optimized Performance
- Problem-solving
- Way to organize data so that we can use this data efficiently
    - e.g. [8,2,1,5,7,8,9,0]
        => **[0,1,2,5,7,8,9]**   


# What is Algorithm?
- A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task


# How to start learning DSA?
The first and foremost thing is dividing the total procedure into little pieces which need to be done sequentially.

The complete process to learn DSA from scratch can be broken into 4 parts:

1. Learn about Time and Space complexities
2. Learn the basics of individual Data Structures
3. Learn the basics of Algorithms
4. Practice Problems on DSA


# How  many way / types  of data structure. 

1. Primitive Data Structure
  - int, float, char, double, boolean

2. Non-Primitive Data Structure
  - Array, Linked, Files
    1. Linear Lists
      - Stack
      - Queues 
    2. Non-Linear Lists
      - Trees
      - Graphs

1. Linear List :
  Linear Data Structures are a type of data structure where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly. Each element has a previous and next adjacent, except for the first and last elements.

2. Non-Linear List :
  Non-Linear Data Structures are a type of data structure where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly. Each element has a previous and next adjacent, except for the first and last elements. Data structures where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, single level is not involved. Therefore, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in single run only. Non-linear data structures are not easy to implement in comparison to linear data structure. It utilizes computer memory efficiently in comparison to a linear data structure. Its examples are (__trees__) and (__graphs__).

# Operation of Data structure:

   1. Traversal : To read the data from the data structure.
   2. Insertion : To add the data to the data structure.
   3. Deletion : To delete the data from the data structure.
   4. Searching : To search the data from the data structure.
   5. Sorting : To sort the data from the data structure.
   6. Merging : To merge the data from the data structure.

# What a kind of data structure is used 
    1. Array
    2. Stack
    3. Queue
    4. Tree 
    5. Graph
    6. Insertion
    7. Recursion
    8. Search
    9. Sorting
    10. Merge
    11. Map
    12. Set
