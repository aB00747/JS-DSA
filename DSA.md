# Why use DSA?
- `DSA => Data + Structure + Algorithm`
- Optimized Performance
- Problem-solving
- Way to organize data so that we can use this data efficiently
    - e.g. [8,2,1,5,7,8,9,0]
        => **[0,1,2,5,7,8,9]**   


# What is Algorithm?
- A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task


# How to start learning DSA?
The first and foremost thing is dividing the total procedure into little pieces which need to be done sequentially.

The complete process to learn DSA from scratch can be broken into 4 parts:

1. Learn about Time and Space complexities
2. Learn the basics of individual Data Structures
3. Learn the basics of Algorithms
4. Practice Problems on DSA


# How  many way / types  of data structure. 

1. Primitive Data Structure
  - int, float, char, double, boolean

2. Non-Primitive Data Structure
  - Array, Linked, Files
    1. Linear Lists
      - Stack
      - Queues 
    2. Non-Linear Lists
      - Trees
      - Graphs

1. Linear List :
  Linear Data Structures are a type of data structure where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly. Each element has a previous and next adjacent, except for the first and last elements.

2. Non-Linear List :
  Non-Linear Data Structures are a type of data structure where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly. Each element has a previous and next adjacent, except for the first and last elements. Data structures where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, single level is not involved. Therefore, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in single run only. Non-linear data structures are not easy to implement in comparison to linear data structure. It utilizes computer memory efficiently in comparison to a linear data structure. Its examples are (__trees__) and (__graphs__).

# Operation of Data structure:

   1. Traversal : To read the data from the data structure.
   2. Insertion : To add the data to the data structure.
   3. Deletion : To delete the data from the data structure.
   4. Searching : To search the data from the data structure.
   5. Sorting : To sort the data from the data structure.
   6. Merging : To merge the data from the data structure.

# What a kind of data structure is used 
    1. Array
    2. Stack
    3. Queue
    4. Tree 
    5. Graph
    6. Insertion
    7. Recursion
    8. Search
    9. Sorting
    10. Merge
    11. Map
    12. Set

# Space Complexity:
  - The more the data the more the space complexity.
  - eg.
    - If there is two program 1st take more space ex. 10kb and 2nd take less space ex. 5kb. Like if our system have only 100kb space then 2nd program will take lesser space than 1st. 2nd have good space complexity.

# Time Complexity:
  - The more the time the more the time complexity.
  - We can't directly calculate the time complexity. It's depend on 
    - processor
    - system 
    - how good is your system is depend on that
    - consider all scenarios, etc.
  - Depend on the number of lines.
    - The lesser the line of code the less the time complexity.
    - The more the line of code the more the time complexity.
  - We can calculate the time complexity with Big O notation.
